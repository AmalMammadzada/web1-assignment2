**Product Display Application**
Welcome to the Product Display Application! This application allows users to browse and search for various products based on categories and view detailed information about selected products.

**Setup Instructions**

Prerequisites
Please make sure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your machine.

**Installation Steps**

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

https://github.com/AmalMammadzada/web1-assignment2.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd product-display-app

**Usage**
When you open the app in your browser, you will see a list of available products divided into different sections.
Use the search bar to search for products by name or select a specific category from the drop-down menu.
Click the "Search" button to view filtered results based on your query.
Navigate through the paginated results using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons at the bottom of the page.
Click the "View Details" button to see detailed information about any product, including images, price, discounts and category.
Additional Notes
This app uses an API (https://dummyjson.com/products) to retrieve product data.
A separate page for product details (productDetails.html) displays specific product information based on the product ID provided in the query parameter.

Thank you!
